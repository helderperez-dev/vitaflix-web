# PRODUCT_CONTEXT: Vitaflix

## 1. The Problem (The "Pain")
Health-conscious individuals and fitness enthusiasts often struggle with **nutritional decision fatigue**. While many apps offer recipes, they fail to provide:
- **Caloric Precision**: Most apps give a generic calorie count that doesn't fit the user's specific daily target.
- **Complexity in Execution**: Users waste time calculating portions or manual tracking in secondary apps.
- **Content Fragmentation**: A lack of high-quality, curated, and standardized video-led nutritional content (the "Netflix" experience).
- **Data Loss/Instability**: As seen in the recent database hack, the current market lacks robust, cloud-synced solutions that maintain high-integrity user data and progress.

## 2. The Solution (The "Wedge")
Vitaflix enters the market as a **Content-First Nutritional Engine**. It differentiates itself through:
- **Caloric Versatility (MealOptions)**: Every single recipe is available in multiple precise caloric versions (e.g., 200, 300, 400, 500 kcal). The user doesn't adapt to the recipe; the recipe adapts to the user.
- **The "Netflix" Experience**: A high-engagement UI focused on browsing high-quality recipe content, categorized by meal types and dietary restrictions.
- **Automated Ecosystem**: A seamless flow where choosing a meal automatically updates the **Meal Plan** and generates a **Shopping List** with specific brand/ingredient matching.
- **Integrated Onboarding**: Capturing physical data (BMR/TMB) during signup to immediately personalize the content feed.

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary**: Portuguese-speaking (Brazil/Portugal) health enthusiasts looking for structured, easy-to-follow meal planning.
- **Secondary**: Users with specific dietary restrictions (Lactose-free, Vegan, Meat/Fish-based) who need a curated catalog.
- **Fitness Level**: Beginners to intermediate users who want to "outsource" the nutritional math to a reliable system.

## 4. Monetization Strategy
Vitaflix operates on a **SaaS (Software as a Service)** subscription model:
- **Subscription Tiers**:
    - **Monthly**: Short-term access for consistent users.
    - **Quarterly**: The "Results" seeker tier.
    - **Annual**: The high-retention, best-value tier for long-term lifestyle changes.
- **Payment Infrastructure**: Fully integrated with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for recurring billing.
- **Gatekeeping**: Core features (Meal Plans, Shopping Lists, Premium Recipes) are locked behind a paywall, with the Onboarding flow serving as the primary conversion funnel.
- **Admin Managed**: Bruno (Founder) maintains total control via a Dashboard to monitor MRR, Churn, and content performance.

## 5. Strategic Vision (2026)
To evolve from a simple recipe app into a **Data-Driven Nutritional Companion**, leveraging AI for semantic search and personalized meal recommendations based on real-time habit tracking.
